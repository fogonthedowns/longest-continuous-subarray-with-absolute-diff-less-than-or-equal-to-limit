Given an array of integers nums and an integer limit, return the size of the longest non-empty subarray such that the absolute difference between any two elements of this subarray is less than or equal to limit.

Input: nums = [8,2,4,7], limit = 4
Output: 2 

0. initialize a min and max []int{}, and count int
loop over input slice ...
1. if the current index is greater or less than the last, for either min and max. Pop off the last element
2. always append the current input value to both min and max lists
3. Get the difference between the first elements in both slices. 
4. If the first element of both min or max is equal to input[count], pop off the first element of either
5. if the difference greater than limit, increment the count.
6. return len(nums) - count
